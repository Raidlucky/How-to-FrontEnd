Welcome to My Front-End lesson, I'm Lucky.
If you run into trouble throughout this course contact me at https://raidlucky.github.io/Projects/
I've got people I really want/need to teach front-end to, so I figured I should make a repo(Repository) to do it.

Let's Start.

1. Take a look at the recommended websites I've listed in recommended-websites.txt
These can be used as more advanced tools after this tutorial; However, This tutorial is good practice overall no matter what
skill level you are.



2. When I was learning front-end I realised the best way to get good at html and css was to recreate things, the nice thing about
html and css is it's all visual and really helps explain what does what.



3. In the recreation folder you'll find examples of things to recreate; if you get stuck or things don't feel like they make sense
feel free to contact me on discord (Lucky'#0001). To recreate something try to remake it just by looking at the image, if you get 
stuck you can see the way i chose to do it with the html and css file



4. The notes files (notes.html, notes.css, and notes.js) are somethign you should be able to come back to in case you forgot how to
do something, feel free to keep them open as you code.
